Summary: In my project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer tenure within the auto insurance industry using 12 months of survey data sourced from Kaggle.com. The aim was to identify the key factors influencing customer tenure over multiple years. Using Power BI Desktop, I created an in-depth dashboard report based on the provided dataset. This involved loading the datasets, performing essential data cleaning and transformation tasks, and leveraging Power BI DAX to generate necessary tables and metrics.

I built a strong data model by establishing relationships based on key attributes, facilitating insightful analysis. Multiple report pages (dashboards) were designed to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), with varied formatting options applied for enhanced clarity and aesthetics. After completion, the report was published to Power BI services and configured for auto-refresh to ensure the data remains current. A dashboard was then created in Power BI services based on the published report, providing users with an intuitive and interactive interface for exploring insights derived from the data.
